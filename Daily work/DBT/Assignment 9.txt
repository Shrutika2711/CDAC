Assignment 9
Querying Multiple Tables at Once.
1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer who made the order.
Ans.	SELECT onum,cname
	FROM orders o,customers c
	WHERE c.cnum=o.cnum ;

2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for each order along with the order number.
Ans.	SELECT sname,cname,onum
	FROM orders o,customers c,salespeople s
	WHERE o.snum=c.snum
  	AND o.snum=s.snum;

3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name, and the salesperson’s rate of commission.
Ans.	mysql> select customers.cname, salespeople.sname, salespeople.comm from customers inner 	join salespeople on customers.snum = salespeople.snum where salespeople.comm > 0.12;

4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each order by a customer with a rating above 100.
Ans.	select salespeople.sname, customers.cname, customers.rating, orders.amt * salespeople.comm 	as sales_person_amt from orders inner join salespeople on orders.snum = salespeople.snum 	inner join customers on customers.cnum = orders.cnum where customers.rating > 100;
